# Tradonaut

Tradonaut is a neural network-based trading system designed for stock market analysis and signal generation. It utilizes advanced deep learning techniques to optimize scalp trading strategies by integrating real-time and historical stock data.

## Project Overview

Tradonaut leverages deep learning for scalp trading by incorporating a variety of data sources and neural network architectures. The system performs feature extraction, temporal and contextual analysis, and reinforcement learning to optimize trading strategies.

## Architecture

The architecture of Tradonaut consists of a specialized set of neural network models:

1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** For extracting features from raw stock data and technical indicators.
2. **Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs):** For modeling temporal dependencies and trends in the data.
3. **Transformer-Based Architectures:** For analyzing long-term dependencies and contextual relationships.

## Workflow and Features

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**

   - Aggregate and preprocess real-time and historical stock data.

2. **Feature Extraction:**

   - Apply CNNs to transform raw data into feature-rich representations.

3. **Sequence Modeling:**

   - Utilize LSTMs to analyze temporal patterns using CNN-extracted features.

4. **Contextual Analysis:**

   - Employ Transformer models to enhance and contextualize the LSTM outputs.

5. **Decision Making:**

   - Integrate insights from CNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers into a reinforcement learning model to generate trading signals.

6. **Reinforcement Learning-Based Training:**

   - Optimize trading strategies through reinforcement learning, leveraging features and patterns identified by CNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers.

7. **Backtesting and Paper Trading Capabilities:**

   - Evaluate strategies with historical data and simulate trading scenarios.

8. **Live Deployment and Monitoring:**
   - Deploy trading strategies in live markets and monitor performance in real-time.
